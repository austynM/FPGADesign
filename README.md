# FPGADesign
FPGA Design Project

In the project I used a hardware description language VHDL to model a controller for a robot to navigate a grid. 
The grid is made up of tiles that are either marked open or blocked.
When the robot travels over an open tile it marks it traveled. 
The robot also has functionality for backtracking if the robot makes it to a corner or a dead end. 
The was coded and then we implemented the code onto Zedboard using the OLED display to display the steps taken to get to the solution. 
Also using the switches and led to input the start point and destination point
